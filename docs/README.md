## Background

#### Use Case Description

#### Proposed Solution

## Setup Overview
```
Overview the Docker-Based Implementation contributed in this Setup (This section is associated with the slide "Setup Overview: Docker-based Implementation" in D3)
```

#### Architecture
A more detailed description of this architecture is available here [Architecture Description](architecture.md)
```
(This section is associated with the slide "Setup Overview: Architecture" in D3)
```

```
Background information and links to relevant terms
```
## Demo
#### Install
In order to install the components of our demo, follow the instructions provided in this file: [Installation & Administration Guide](installationguide.md)
```
Within the docs folder, the "installationguide.md" is to be filled with information on how to install the demo components
and their dependencies.

A convenient simulator or simulated/dummy datasets will be contributed when the source code, binaries, and/or functionality
of a given component cannot be shared as part of the public demo due to privacy- or deployment-related issues.
```

#### Usage
Information about how to use the demo components can be found in the [User & Programmers Manual](usermanual.md).
```
Within the docs folder, the "installationguide.md" is to be filled with information on how to use and configure the
components of the demo.
```

#### API
Detailed descriptions of the demo component APIs are available in the [API documentation](api.md) 
```
Within the docs folder, the "api.md" is to be filled with the definition of component APIs.

Special emphasis will be put on the description of NGSI APIs, providing tas many details as possible on the 
the subscriptions, registrations, requests, and responses associated with each component of the demo. 

Non-NGSI APIs will be fully described only if they define an interface to an NGSI-Compliant component.

Non-NGSI APIs in charge of enabling interfaces between components that are totally opaque from the NGSI
point of view will be listed and/or shortly described if they are of relevance to understand, install or
use the demo.
```

#### Testing

```
This section will contribute step-by-step procedures to perform a basic end-to-end test of the setup 
features described in the mid-term review demo. For each test, the definition of the step-by-tep procedure
may consist of:
- Description of the use case that the test aim to cover
- Definition of the required inputs and steps to retrieve meaningful outputs
- A convenient simulator or simulated/dummy datasets to validate the use case in cases where the source 
code, binaries, and/or functionality of a given component cannot be shared as part of the public demo.
