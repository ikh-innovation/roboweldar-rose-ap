## How to run the component instance

The [Compose](docker-compose.yml) file associated with this repository can
be used to run the component in the following way:

```console
docker-compose up .
```

This [Compose](docker-compose.yml) file defines three services: The [server module](https://github.com/ikh-innovation/roboweldar-networking/tree/master/server), the [3D reconstruction module](https://github.com/ikh-innovation/roboweldar-3d-reconstruction), and the [weld seam detection module](https://github.com/ikh-innovation/roboweldar-weld-seam-detection).

The server module is instantiated by pulling an image thatâ€™s built from the Dockerfile in the `server` directory of the respective repository, using the integration pipeline from Dockerhub. It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 3000 (HTTP) and 3001 (Websocket). 
The same is valid for the 3D reconstruction module and the weld seam detection module.


## Building the images locally

If you would like the [Compose](docker-compose.yml) file to use locally built images of the above modules, you may opt to build them yourself. Docker build instructions are found in each respective repository.
