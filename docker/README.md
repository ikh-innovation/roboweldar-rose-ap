## How to build an image

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jason-fox/TTE.project1/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) associated with this image can
be used to build an image in several ways:

-   By default, the `Dockerfile` retrieves the **latest** version of the codebase direct from GitHub (the `build-arg` is
    optional):

```console
docker build -t <component> . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=latest
```

-   You can alter this to obtain the last **stable** release run this `Dockerfile` with the build argument
    `DOWNLOAD=stable`

```console
docker build -t <component> . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=stable
```

-   You can also download a specific release by running this `Dockerfile` with the build argument `DOWNLOAD=<version>`

```console
docker build -t <component> . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=1.7.0
```

## Building from your own fork

To download code from your own fork of the GitHub repository add the `GITHUB_ACCOUNT`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and
`SOURCE_BRANCH` arguments (default `master`) to the `docker build` command.

```console
docker build -t <component> . \
    --build-arg GITHUB_ACCOUNT=<your account> \
    --build-arg GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<your repo> \
    --build-arg SOURCE_BRANCH=<your branch>
```

## Building from your own source files

Alternatively, if you want to build directly from your own sources, please copy the existing `Dockerfile` into file the
root of the repository and amend it to copy over your local source using :

```Dockerfile
COPY . /opt/component/
```

Full instructions can be found within the `Dockerfile` itself.

### Using PM2

The Component within the Docker image can be run encapsulated within the [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) Process
Manager by adding the `PM2_ENABLED` environment variable.

```console
docker run --name component -e PM2_ENABLED=true -d fiware/component-ul
```

Use of pm2 is **disabled** by default. It is unnecessary and counterproductive to add an additional process manager if
your dockerized environment is already configured to restart Node.js processes whenever they exit (e.g. when using
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/))
